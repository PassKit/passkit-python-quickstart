### Overview

This quickstart aims to help  get Python developers up and running with the PassKit SDK as quickly as possible.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following:

- A PassKit account (signup for free at https://app.passkit.com)
- Your PassKit SDK Credentials (available from the https://app.passkit.com/app/account/developer-tools)
- Python 3.7 or above from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/install/overview-jdk-installation.html - guide on how to download)
- Gradle Build Tool from https://gradle.org/install/ with guide on how to install
- Apple wallet certificate id (for flights only, https://app.passkit.com/app/account/certificates)

 - The following Python packages:
  - `passkit-python-grpc-sdk`
  - `protobuf>=5.26`
  - `grpcio>=1.60`
  - `grpcio-tools>=1.60`
  - `protoc-gen-openapiv2`
  - `googleapis-common-protos`

You can install all required Python packages with:

`pip install passkit-python-grpc-sdk "protobuf>=5.26" "grpcio>=1.60" "grpcio-tools>=1.60" protoc-gen-openapiv2 googleapis-common-protos`
 

### Configuration

1. Download or clone this quickstart repository, create a folder `certs` in the resources folder of the repository and add the following three PassKit credential files:
    - certificate.pem
    - ca-chain.pem
    - key.pem
    
    You can disregard the key-java.pem credentials file as it is not compatible with Python.
2. Use `pip install passkit-python-grpc-sdk` to download the latest sdk from python or use `pip install passkit-python-grpc-sdk --upgrade` to upgrade to the latest.
